This python script receives as input an image which will be classified. As for the dataset that will be used for the classifier training and validation, 4 additional .tiff images were imported, where each one of them corresponds to a classification category ( more may be imported depending on the classification categories ). The final; classifed image is saved on .tiff format as well as being displayed in the screen. The confusion matrix and the overall accuracy are being displayed also.
